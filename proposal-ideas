Ideas
1. Difference between two human genomes is at max 0.1%
2. So, we need to store only the diff.
3. The diff would contain a lot of zeroes, we can use RLE to compress this.
4. Later, we can use Huffman encoding for further compression
5. Huffman encoding would be done on a per chromosome basis, so that we can exploit
patterns in a diff which are local to a chromosome. Or we can choose a smaller unit
like Gene or something, do on Huffman on individually.
