Ideas
1. Difference between two human genomes is at max 0.1% - (madhava: questionable)
2. So, we need to store only the diff.
3. The diff would contain a lot of zeroes, we can use RLE to compress this.
4. Later, we can use Huffman encoding for further compression
5. Huffman encoding would be done on a per chromosome basis, so that we can exploit
patterns in a diff which are local to a chromosome. Or we can choose a smaller unit
like Gene or something, do on Huffman on individually.


more:
6. Use reference genome.
7. Encode edit distance - is this smaller than compression? what to use as reference  (or where to edit from) (commonly occuring approximate n-letter string patterns)?
8. SNP reference for more compression - SNPs are common sequences that differ in 1 letter, usually existing in only one of 2 forms.
9. What variations occur? - SNPs, copy number variations (deletions, inversions, insertions and duplications)
